Previously served as a research assistant at the University of Edinburgh, Tsinghua University, and the South China Collaborative Innovation Research Institute, where I was deeply involved in data science-related research projects. I collaborated with UNICEF to analyse multi-source data on child welfare issues, providing data-driven recommendations.

In addition, I have worked as a consultant at two consulting firms, helping businesses leverage data-driven strategies, business analytics, and digital transformation to achieve their goals. With a strong foundation in data analysis and modelling, I excel at extracting valuable insights from complex datasets and translating them into actionable business strategies.

I have extensive experience working in cross-functional teams, driving the implementation and optimisation of data-driven projects. Combining technical expertise with business acumen, I am dedicated to transforming data science into tangible business value.
